Once you are done with the client\nyou should call `client.close()` to close the connection and free up resources. Alternatively, you can use the client as a context manager\nin a `with` statement, which will automatically close the connection when the context is exited. See the examples below for details.\n\nSee [the docs](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/installation/embedded#embedded-options) for more details.",
