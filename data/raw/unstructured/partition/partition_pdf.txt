    """Parses a pdf document into a list of interpreted elements.
    Parameters
    ----------
    filename
        A string defining the target filename path.
    file
        A file-like object as bytes --> open(filename, "rb").
    strategy
        The strategy to use for partitioning the PDF. Valid strategies are "hi_res",
        "ocr_only", and "fast". When using the "hi_res" strategy, the function uses
        a layout detection model to identify document elements. When using the
        "ocr_only" strategy, partition_pdf simply extracts the text from the
        document using OCR and processes it. If the "fast" strategy is used, the text
        is extracted directly from the PDF. The default strategy `auto` will determine
        when a page can be extracted using `fast` mode, otherwise it will fall back to `hi_res`.
    infer_table_structure
        Only applicable if `strategy=hi_res`.
        If True, any Table elements that are extracted will also have a metadata field
        named "text_as_html" where the table's text content is rendered into an html string.
        I.e., rows and cells are preserved.
        Whether True or False, the "text" field is always present in any Table element
        and is the text content of the table (no structure).
    ocr_languages
        The languages to use for the Tesseract agent. To use a language, you'll first need
        to isntall the appropriate Tesseract language pack.
    max_partition
        The maximum number of characters to include in a partition. If None is passed,
        no maximum is applied. Only applies to the "ocr_only" strategy.
