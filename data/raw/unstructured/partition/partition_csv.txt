    """Partitions Microsoft Excel Documents in .csv format into its document elements.

    Parameters
    ----------
    filename
        A string defining the target filename path.
    file
        A file-like object using "rb" mode --> open(filename, "rb").
    metadata_filename
        The filename to use for the metadata.
    metadata_last_modified
        The last modified date for the document.
    include_header
        Determines whether or not header info info is included in text and medatada.text_as_html.
    include_metadata
        Determines whether or not metadata is included in the output.
    infer_table_structure
        If True, any Table elements that are extracted will also have a metadata field
        named "text_as_html" where the table's text content is rendered into an html string.
        I.e., rows and cells are preserved.
        Whether True or False, the "text" field is always present in any Table element
        and is the text content of the table (no structure).
    languages
        User defined value for `metadata.languages` if provided. Otherwise language is detected
        using naive Bayesian filter via `langdetect`. Multiple languages indicates text could be
        in either language.
